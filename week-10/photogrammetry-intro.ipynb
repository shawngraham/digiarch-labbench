    "So that's more or less how it all works. You take the .obj, .mtl, and the texture.jpg files and zip those up. Then, you can upload them to a 3d object viewer like sketchfab.com. Or go to [https://3dviewer.net/](https://3dviewer.net/) and drag the .obj, .mtl, and the texture jpg onto the screen.\n",

    "Our castle looks a bit ... trippy. And that's because I haven't bothered to figure out yet all the niggling details that would resolve the outliers and odd bits of data artefacts. Because the approach here is meant to show you the basic logic and flow, the final output isn't as nice as a more robust dataset and approach might create.\n",

    "Compare the result with what you might get with an older piece of software called [Regard3d](https://www.regard3d.org/index.php/download). It bundles all of the steps we've done here together into a user interface and critically, shows you the output of each step and allows you to play with all the possible variables so that you can address the issues visible in our result here. Windows users might try [Zephyr Free](https://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-free/); there are plenty of apps for IOS and Android, if you want to try things that way.\n",

    "A more technically sophisticated technique is 'gaussian splatting', which takes a video as input. The technique uses a kind of neural network approach for rendering the data. Essentially, while the sfm approach we used here identifies points in the images, gaussian splatting considers each point as a whole distribution of values. You can imagine what the math would be like. The upshot is you get much better results that aren't as fragile as the sfm approach. You can give it a try [with this google colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/benyoon1/gaussian-splat-colab/blob/main/gsplat_colab_template.ipynb#scrollTo=Jg-_TYBaJkcD). Here's some [introductory material explaining the main idea](https://huggingface.co/blog/gaussian-splatting). And as it happens, [poly.cam](https://poly.cam) can do both approaches so you can see the difference for yourself.\n",

    "Make a folder in the week 10 workbench. Put your photos from the graveyard in there. Make a copy of these notebook, then open it. Go back to the section 1 of the notebook and change the data input to point to your folder of images (so not the download cells, right!). Work through the notebook again, but swapping in your data at each step. See how it goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, go try [poly.cam](https://poly.cam/). You can get a free account and use their platform to turn both images and videos into photogrammetric sfm models _or_ guassian splats - but be careful to not get upsold beyond the free tier. These folks have professional developers working on making their algorithms the best in the business, so you'll definitely get better results than my code, as long as your input images have sufficient overlap. Use your images and videos you captured when you were at the graveyard. Download a model it makes and put it in your github repository. Evaluate the quality of your model. What might your model be *good for*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also - explore the poly.cam interface carefully. If a model is built right, you can actually read measurements and dimensions from the 3d model, and that is certainly handy for communicating the results of your research or making it useful for others."
