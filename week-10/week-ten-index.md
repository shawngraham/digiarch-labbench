## Week Ten

This week is about playful ways you can communicate archaeological materials with the public

## 3d Models

- this notebook shows you the basic theory of photogrammetry: [[photogrammetry-intro.ipynb]] although you will get better results with the computing power a commercial service can give you (although you can try to install [REgard3d](https://www.regard3d.org/) on your machine. Regard follows the same processes but has a few more algorithms etc than I can give you in the notebook.)

## A Static Website

- the dream of the web was the easy sharing of information; you don't have to be locked into Facebook etc. This exercise _does not_ use a computational notebook, but _does_ use the terminal functionality of your workbench.

## Sonification

- what might we hear if we listen to our data? [[sonification.ipynb]]
