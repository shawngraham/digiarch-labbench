# What is Personal Knowledge Management?

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is a practice and philosophy for organizing, connecting, and growing your understanding over time. For digital humanists, PKM provides a bridge between traditional scholarly practices and computational methods.

## Why PKM Matters for Digital Humanities

### The Information Problem
Modern scholars face unprecedented challenges:
- **Information overload**: Too much to read and process
- **Siloed knowledge**: Ideas trapped in separate documents/disciplines  
- **Lost connections**: Insights forgotten or difficult to relocate
- **Linear constraints**: Traditional writing forces artificial sequences

### PKM as Solution
PKM systems like this one address these challenges by:
- **Connecting ideas** across time and contexts
- **Reducing cognitive load** through external memory systems
- **Enabling serendipity** through unexpected link discovery
- **Supporting non-linear thinking** natural to research

## Core PKM Principles

### 1. **Links Over Hierarchies**
Traditional organization uses folders and categories:
```
Research/
  ├── Medieval Pottery/
  ├── Digital Methods/
  └── Theory/
```

PKM uses networks of connections (note that these links are in red because the note doesn't exist yet: but in this way we can start mapping the things we will want to know):
- [[medieval-pottery]] connects to [[digital-imaging]]
- [[network-analysis]] relates to [[social-history]]  
- [[computational-methods]] informs [[close-reading]]

**Why this matters**: Humanities knowledge is inherently interconnected. Medieval literature connects to gender studies, which relates to digital archives, which informs computational analysis.

### 2. **Atomic Notes**
Each note focuses on **one idea** or **atom of thought** that can be:
- **Understood independently** 
- **Connected to multiple contexts**
- **Reused across projects**
- **Built upon over time**
- Literature review: use the @ symbol to indicate a note that contains the precis for an academic article, referenced by the author and year

**Example**: Instead of one big file called "Research Notes on Amazonian Archaeology," filled with everything you've collected, create separate notes that you can later link together:
- [[terra-preta]]
- [[orinoco-rock-art]]
- [[@riris-oliver-2024]]
- [[lidar-and-remote-sensing]]

### 3. **Progressive Development**
Knowledge builds incrementally:
- Start with **simple observations**
- Add **connections** as you discover them
- **Revisit and expand** notes over time
- Let **complex ideas emerge** from simple building blocks

### 4. **Externalized Thinking**
Your PKM system becomes a **second brain**:
- **Offload memory** to focus on thinking
- **Make implicit connections explicit**
- **Track your intellectual development**
- **Build on past insights**

## PKM in Academic Context

### Traditional Academic Writing
1. Research → 2. Outline → 3. Write → 4. Revise

**Problems**: 
- Ideas emerge during writing but can't reshape early research
- Connections between projects are lost
- Knowledge stays locked in finished papers

### PKM-Enhanced Scholarship
**Continuous cycle**:
- **Collect** → **Connect** → **Create** → **Reflect** → **Revise**

**Benefits**:
- Ideas compound across projects
- Unexpected connections generate new insights  
- Research becomes cumulative rather than project-based
- Writing emerges from network of developed ideas

## PKM and Computational Thinking

Digital humanities combines interpretive and computational approaches. PKM bridges these by:

### Supporting Both Modes
- **Interpretive work**: Connect themes, build arguments, trace influences
- **Computational work**: Document methods, link code to questions, embed results

### Linking Analysis to Argument
Instead of separate "analysis" and "writing" phases:
- Embed [[computational-results]] directly in interpretive notes
- Link [[methodology-notes]] to specific research questions
- Connect [[code-experiments]] to theoretical frameworks

### Example Integration

The text below shows a (very minimal) example of how your writing can integrate networked ways of representing knowledge. Notice the ! which embeds the output from cell 3 of the point-pattern-analysis computational notebook.

```markdown
# Terra Preta and its co-occurence with Rock Art

## Computational Analysis
![[point-pattern-analysis.ipynb#cell:3:output]]

## Interpretive Framework  
The analysis above supports [[separate-spheres-of-influence]] 
by showing limited clustering across time and space.

## Related Concepts

- [[remote-sensing-aerial]]
- [[terra-preta]]
```

## Building Your PKM Practice

### Start Simple
1. **Create atomic notes** about concepts you're learning
2. **Link generously** - when in doubt, make the connection
3. **Review regularly** - revisit notes to discover new patterns
4. **Don't over-organize** - let structure emerge

### Develop Gradually
- **Week 1**: Focus on creating notes and basic links
- **Week 2**: Start using backlinks to discover connections  
- **Week 3**: Begin embedding content and building synthesis notes
- **Ongoing**: Let your system evolve with your thinking

### Make it Sustainable
- **Regular review**: Spend 10 minutes weekly exploring your network
- **Capture quickly**: Don't let perfect organization prevent good note-taking
- **Connect actively**: Always ask "What does this relate to?"
- **Trust emergence**: Complex insights arise from simple, consistent practices

## PKM Tools and Philosophy

This JupyterLab environment combines:
- **Computational capabilities** (notebooks, data analysis)
- **Networked thinking** (wikilinks, backlinks) 
- **Academic writing** (markdown, embedding)
- **Version control** (all changes tracked)

**Why this combination works**: Digital humanities requires moving fluidly between computational analysis and interpretive synthesis. PKM provides the connective tissue.

There are many platforms that enable this kind of workflow, including Obsidian, Tangent, Joplin, and others.
## Common Misconceptions

**"PKM is just fancy note-taking"**
→ PKM transforms how you think, not just how you store information

**"I need to organize everything perfectly first"**  
→ Organization emerges from use, not upfront planning

**"This is too much overhead for my research"**
→ PKM reduces cognitive overhead by externalizing connections

**"I should wait until I have more content"**
→ Start immediately - networks become valuable quickly

**Reflection Question**: How might your current research practices change if you could easily discover connections between projects, remember insights across semesters, and build cumulative understanding rather than starting fresh each time?
