## Week Seven

Meaning emerges from relationships. This week, we use computational neural networks (the substrate for what is conventionally now called 'ai') to do some interesting archaeological work.

### Classification
- What kind of pottery ware does this sherd come from: [[image-classifier.ipynb]]
- What is most similar? [[image-similarity.ipynb]]

### Latent Space within Discourses
- Representing the statistics of language enables us to plumb the gaps _between_ the words as written. Navigate these latent spaces in the writing of early archaeologist Flinders Petrie: [[practical-necromancy.ipynb]]

## RAG
- If we can do that for language, we can do it for systematically described data and metadata: [[archaeo_rag.ipynb]]
