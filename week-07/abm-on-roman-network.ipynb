    "## Agent Based Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent-based simulation allows you to model complex phenomena by specifying the behaviours and population characterstics of the agents at a lower level of complexity. If you are interested in how human cooperation gives rise to settlements, you might try to model a small population of humans and give them basic ruls of behaviour about how they exploit or share resources. Then you run the model thousands of times, each time changing the various settings for your model such that you have data on multiple runs, multiple times across the full gamut of the possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called 'sweeping the behaviour space', and it helps you validate or demonstrate that your model is simulating the phenomenon correctly (eg, you haven't made some error of code that is having an impact on any emergent effects you spot). Then you can fit the archaeological evidence against your model to see what the model says about that combination of evidence, ie, 'I've got data that looks like this; the model reproduces that distribution only when 'altruism' is high and 'resources' are high, which therefore suggests...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are building this model using a version of the Netlogo programming language ported to R. Netlogo comes with its own programming environment; you can check it out [behind this link](https://netlogoweb.org/). You might want to select the web version just to play around with that interface and explore some of the demonstration models - are there any that might usefully be 'reconceptualized' for archaeological or historical situations? It's often easier to start with an exsiting model and then modify it for yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Netlogo code is pretty readable - here's the main code chunk for a model about a spreading virus on a network:\n",
    "\n",
    "```netlogo\n",
    "to go\n",
    "  if all? turtles [not infected?]\n",
    "    [ stop ]\n",
    "  ask turtles\n",
    "  [\n",
    "     set virus-check-timer virus-check-timer + 1\n",
    "     if virus-check-timer >= virus-check-frequency\n",
    "       [ set virus-check-timer 0 ]\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  spread-virus\n",
    "  do-virus-checks\n",
    "  tick\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of those commands calls smaller chunks of code. It's a relatively easy language to get started with and then do interesting/complicated things! I wrote a model once about the [triggers of civil violence in the Roman world](https://www.digitalstudies.org/article/id/7198/). The argument of the simulation is expressed in its code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I didn't want to have you downloading and installing another platform (netlogo depends on Java, and I just didn't want to face installing that on all of your different machines); we'll use the version of Netlogo for R here as I build a simple model. Read it carefully to see what's going on. At the end of this, I'll suggest trying to make some changes to enable you to explore what the model might mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation is a simple model of information diffusion along the connections between cities in the Roman empire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further, what do you think will happen when it runs? Read through it and try to get a sense of what might happen. What might we learn from this model?\n"

    "What does this mean? Do you know of any phenomena in the ancient Roman world that might map onto this simple model of diffusion that we created? This model is similar to the [[virus-on-a-network.ipynb]] model, though with a different mechanic in mind when it comes of 'infection'. What are some ways you might want to extend this model to better capture... economic change? social change? cultural phenomena? disease? One thing that springs to mind is that I might want to know the difference that the pattern of interconnections make. I might want to run these dynamics on simple network structures - rings, stars, small-worlds, random - and measure what emerges, then compare to this Roman network. Alternatively, or additionally, maybe the S-I-R model of disease infection is similar to how ideas spread- people are open to an idea, people are resistant to an idea, people are lit on fire by an idea. Maybe an agent with an 'idea' can be made to wander not randomly, but deliberately seek people out.\n",
