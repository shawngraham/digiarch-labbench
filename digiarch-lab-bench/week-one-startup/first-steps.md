When you clicked the red link [[questions-I-have-about-digital-archaeology]] from the start page, this system:

1. **Detected a broken link** (shown in red)
2. **Created a new file** when you clicked it  
3. **Established a connection** between the start page and this tutorial

This is **non-linear thinking** in action - the foundation of both digital humanities methodology and personal knowledge management. (And note that the link on _this_ page, now that you created that particular note, is blue showing that the page exists.)
## Your Digital Workspace

Look around the interface. You'll see:

- **File browser** (left sidebar) - Navigate your knowledge network
- **Main editor/preview area** (center) - Read and write content
- **Floating mode button** (bottom-left) - Switch between editing and preview
- **Menu bar** (top) - Access tools and commands

### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn these four shortcuts - they're your gateway to efficient digital scholarship:

- **`Alt/Option+M`** - Toggle between editing and preview modes
- **`Alt/Option+F`** - Search across all your notes and notebooks  
- **`Alt/Option+B`** - See backlinks (what links to this file)
- **`Ctrl/Cmd+Click`** - Follow any wikilink

**Try it now**: Press `Alt+M` to see the raw markdown behind this formatted text. Press it again to return to preview mode.

## Understanding Wikilinks

Wikilinks are the backbone of connected thinking in digital humanities. They represent **relationships between ideas**, just like citations in academic writing, but more flexible.

### Basic Syntax
- `[[file-name]]` - Links to another note
- `[[file-name|Display Text]]` - Link with custom text
- `[[notebook.ipynb]]` - Link to computational notebooks
- `[[data.csv]]` - Link to datasets

### Try Creating Connections

Practice by clicking these links to create new notes:

1. [[my-research-interests]] - Map your academic interests
2. [[key-concepts]] - Define important terms for your studies  
3. [[weekly-reflections]] - Space for ongoing thoughts
4. [[project-ideas]] - Brainstorm future research

Each click creates a new file and establishes a connection. This is how digital humanists build **research networks** rather than isolated documents.

## Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Principles

### 1. **Start Small, Think Big**
Begin with simple notes. Connections emerge over time.

### 2. **Link Liberally** 
When you mention a concept, person, or idea, make it a wikilink. Ask: "Might I want to explore this further?"

### 3. **Build Bidirectionally**
Use the backlinks panel (`Alt+B`) to see unexpected connections. Knowledge networks have emergent properties.

### 4. **Embrace Emergence**
Don't over-organize initially. Let structures emerge through use and connection.

## Digital Humanities Mindset

Digital archaeology, as I view it, is very much part of the Digital Humanities. As you work in this system, you're practicing core DH skills:

- **Non-linear thinking** - Moving between connected ideas
- **Iterative development** - Building understanding progressively  
- **Documentation practices** - Recording process, not just results
- **Collaborative scholarship** - Creating shareable, linked knowledge

## Your First Tasks

Before moving on, complete these steps:

1. **Practice mode switching**: Hit `Alt+M` several times to get comfortable
2. **Create your first connection**: Click [[my-research-interests]] and write 2-3 sentences about what interests you academically
3. **Try the search function**: Press `Alt+F` and search for "digital"
4. **Explore backlinks**: Press `Alt+B` to see what links to this tutorial
