# CLCV3000|HIST3000 Intro to Digital Archaeology

**Doing Digital Archaeology in your Personal Knowledge Management Lab**

Welcome to this Introduction to Digital Archaeology. This interactive environment combines the power of computational notebooks with personal knowledge management (PKM) techniques. Think of this as your "digital lab notebook" where you'll learn to connect ideas, build knowledge networks, and use computational tools for archaeological research.
## üéØ What You'll Learn Here

- **Knowledge networking**: How to connect ideas across time and disciplines
- **Digital research methods in archaeology**: Basic computational approaches to archaeological research  
- **Academic writing with code**: Integrating analysis and argumentation
- **Personal knowledge management**: Building systems to support lifelong learning

> [!WARNING] Warning # 1
You need to use the Google CHROME or Microsoft EDGE browsers for all of the functions of this site to work properly. Firefox users will encounter problems with loading and saving data from .ipynb files.

> [!WARNING] Warning # 2
> This system is saving everything you do to the browser's memory. At the end of each session, you should DOWNLOAD any files you make or modify to a folder on your computer for back up, just in case. If you clear your browser's cache - the place where it saves everything - you can lose everything.

I built this site as part of my research into making research platforms where writing and analysis are combined in quasi-public ways (more on this later in the course). In which case, there may be weird bugs in the platform. Part of doing digital archaeology is about documenting process which includes the bugs and glitches!

That said, AS AN ALTERNATIVE, or if you run into trouble using this site, you may download all of the course materials from [this link] and use Obsidian plus the Google Colab service.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Understanding This Interface
You're looking at a **markdown file** - a simple way to format text that's widely used in digital scholarship. Notice the floating button that says "üìù Switch to Edit" - click it to see the raw text behind this formatted view.

**Try it now**: Click the edit button, make a small change, then click the preview button to return to this view.

### Step 2: Your First Wikilink
Digital humanists often work with interconnected ideas. We use **wikilinks** to connect related concepts:

Try clicking this link: [[questions-I-have-about-digital-archaeology]]

Notice it's red because the file doesn't exist yet. In PKM systems, clicking broken links creates new files - this is how knowledge networks grow organically.

(In the editor window, you can hold the shift key and click on a link to follow it).
### Step 3: Explore the Basics
Start your learning journey with these guided tutorials:

1. **[[interface-basics]]** - Learn the tools and keyboard shortcuts
2. **[[what-is-pkm]]** - Understanding personal knowledge management  
3. **[[connecting-ideas]]** - Building your first knowledge network

In week two you can try:
1. **[[computational-thinking]]** - Introduction to digital methods methods
2. **[[your-first-analysis]]** - Hands-on work with data

## üîó Quick Reference

**Navigation**:
- `Alt+M` - Switch between editing and preview  
- `Alt+F` - Search all your notes
- `Alt+B` - See what links to current file
- `Ctrl/Cmd+Click` - Follow any link

**Creating Connections**:
- `[[link-name]]` - Link to other notes
- `![[note-name#heading]]` - Embed content from other notes
- Type `[[` for auto-completion suggestions

## üí° Your Learning Strategy

This environment is designed to help you **think like a digital humanist**:

1. **Make connections**: Use wikilinks to relate new concepts to what you already know
2. **Document your thinking**: Create notes about your questions and insights  
3. **Build progressively**: Start simple, add complexity as you learn
4. **Experiment safely**: This is your space to try things out
