    "# Agent Based Simulation\n",
    "An agent-based simulation allows you to model complex phenomena by specifying the behaviours and population characterstics of the agents at a lower level of complexity. If you are interested in how human cooperation gives rise to settlements, you might try to model a small population of humans and give them basic ruls of behaviour about how they exploit or share resources. Then you run the model thousands of times, each time changing the various settings for your model such that you have data on multiple runs, multiple times across the full gamut of the possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called 'sweeping the behaviour space', and it helps you validate or demonstrate that your model is simulating the phenomenon correctly (eg, you haven't made some error of code that is having an impact on any emergent effects you spot). Then you can fit the archaeological evidence against your model to see what the model says about that combination of evidence, ie, 'I've got data that looks like this; the model reproduces that distribution only when 'altruism' is high and 'resources' are high, which therefore suggests...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are building this model using a version of the Netlogo programming language ported to R. Netlogo comes with its own programming environment; you can check it out [behind this link](https://netlogoweb.org/). You might want to select the web version just to play around with that interface and explore some of the demonstration models - are there any that might usefully be 'reconceptualized' for archaeological or historical situations? It's often easier to start with an exsiting model and then modify it for yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Netlogo code is pretty readable - here's the main code chunk for a model about a spreading virus on a network:\n",
    "\n",
    "```netlogo\n",
    "to go\n",
    "  if all? turtles [not infected?]\n",
    "    [ stop ]\n",
    "  ask turtles\n",

    "     set virus-check-timer virus-check-timer + 1\n",
    "     if virus-check-timer >= virus-check-frequency\n",

    "  spread-virus\n",
    "  do-virus-checks\n",
    "  tick\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of those commands calls smaller chunks of code. It's a relatively easy language to get started with and then do interesting/complicated things! I wrote a model once about the [triggers of civil violence in the Roman world](https://www.digitalstudies.org/article/id/7198/). The argument of the simulation is expressed in its code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I didn't want to have you downloading and installing another platform; we'll use the version of Netlogo for R here as I build a simple model. Read it carefully to see what's going on. At the end of this, I show you how you can set up an experiment. The code here is created in a similar way to the Netlogo example mode, '[Virus on a Network](https://netlogoweb.org/launch#https://netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Networks/Virus%20on%20a%20Network.nlogo)':\n",
    "\n",
    "> This model demonstrates the spread of a virus through a network. Although the model is somewhat abstract, one interpretation is that each node represents a computer, and we are modeling the progress of a computer virus (or worm) through this network. Each node may be in one of three states: susceptible, infected, or resistant. In the academic literature such a model is sometimes referred to as an SIR model for epidemics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine its a network of individuals in a city, infected by the [Plague of Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian). Examine the code, and then in the experiment section, adjust the parameters to match your idea of that plague's dynamics. What do you change? What is missing? How does the model behave? What breaks? Why? What does the simulation suggest re the events of 541-544?\n"
