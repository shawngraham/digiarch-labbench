    "# SPARQL and LOD\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the early dream of the worldwide web was that data could be described semantically, and so when website A discussed eg Roman coins, and website B also discussed Roman coins, it would be possible for the very links themselves to contain the metadata that would alert us to when we were talking about the same thing, or same kind of thing. What if you could write some code to retrieve all of the information, everywhere, about Roman coins minted under Augustus from a particular mint, no matter what academic or museum or commercial database held relevant information? This was/is the promise of linked open data, and the query language for exploring those linkages, SPARQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is described using a 'Resource Description Framework', RDF, the resource - the 'thing'- is described via a series of relationships, rather than as rows in a table or keys having values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information is in the relationships. It's a network. It's a graph. Thus, every 'thing' in this graph can have its own uniform resource identifier (URI) that lives as a location on the internet. Information can then be created by making statements that use these URIs, similarly to how English grammar creates meaning: subject verb object. Or, in RDF-speak, 'subject predicate object', also known as a triple. In this way, data in different places can be linked together by referencing the elements they have in common. This is Linked Open Data (LOD). The access point for interrogating LOD is called an 'endpoint'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, SPARQL is an acronymn for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (yes, it's one of those kinds of acronyms).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're using R to interact with and query an endpoint providing access to numismatic evidence from the Roman world, and manipulate linked open data, but for the sake of learning a bit of what one can do with SPARQL, this notebook keeps all of that ancillary code tucked away. The [followup notebook](Using R to Retrieve and Visualize Data from SPARQL.ipynb) to this one shows you how to use R to do some basic manipulations of the query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Matthew Lincoln once wrote an excellent tutorial at the Programming Historian about SPARQL and LOD](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/retired/graph-databases-and-SPARQL) but that tutorial depended on an endpoint maintained by the British Museum. The museum no longer maintains that endpoint, rendering Lincoln's tutorial obsolete in terms of its examples. But it _is_ an excellent intro to the key ideas, parts of which I am reproducing below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at his example, which concerns the painting, 'The Nightwatch'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rdf\n",
    "<The Nightwatch> <was created by> <Rembrandt van Rijn> .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement has three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    the subject: <The Nightwatch>\n",
    "    the predicate: <was created by>\n",
    "    the object: <Rembrandt van Rijn>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lincoln combines these, and other such statements, into a (pseudo-)RDF database like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<The Nightwatch> <was created by> <Rembrandt van Rijn> .\n",
    "<The Nightwatch> <was created in> <1642> .\n",
    "<The Nightwatch> <has medium> <oil on canvas> .\n",
    "<Rembrandt van Rijn> <was born in> <1606> .\n",
    "<Rembrandt van Rijn> <has nationality> <Dutch> .\n",
    "<Johannes Vermeer> <has nationality> <Dutch> .\n",
    "<Woman with a Balance> <was created by> <Johannes Vermeer> .\n",
    "<Woman with a Balance> <has medium> <oil on canvas> .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such RDF databases are describing nodes and links, and so we can visualize as a graph like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6c12a0f4f4c91fd87c787e790037151c2c3024849472e4740673d321370e073c/68747470733a2f2f70726f6772616d6d696e67686973746f7269616e2e6f72672f696d616765732f67726170682d6461746162617365732d616e642d53504152514c2f73706172716c30312e737667)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is rather different than the tables and their intersections that we've discussed and read about so far this week! You can see that _adding_ information to this database is as simple (relatively) as adding a new relationship to the graph. This is one of the reasons why graph databases have become more popular in recent years, especially with the evolution of the web and social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lincoln suggests that we think of SPARQL queries as a kind of 'mad lib', where there is a structure and we just fill in the blanks. We specify what kind of data we want in those blanks, and the query traverses the graph looking for data that correctly fills it in. Sticking with art history, he shows us this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT ?painting\n",
    "WHERE {\n",
    "  ?painting <has medium> <oil on canvas> .\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The query goes off and looks for every painting that was made with oil on canvas. Visually, it looks a bit like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://programminghistorian.org/images/graph-databases-and-SPARQL/sparql02.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "and we'd end up with a table with a column called 'painting' and the titles of each painting listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a difference between the pseudo-RDF that Lincoln shows us, and what actual RDF might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<http://data.rijksmuseum.nl/item/8909812347> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator>  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rembrandt>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The human-readable version requires more statements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<http://data.rijksmuseum.nl/item/8909812347> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> \"The Nightwatch\" .\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rembrandt> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> \"Rembrandt van Rijn\" .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, we're going to draw on the [Nomisma.org](https://nomisma.org) project which created and maintains an **ontology** or formalized descriptive framework for working with archaeological numismatic materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lincoln suggests that when we first encountered a new RDF graph, that we explore the network of relationships from an example object to understand what is going on in the database, to see what is available for querying. In the query below, p and o stand for 'predicate' and 'object'. This could give you the necessary information to construct more complicated queries.\n"
