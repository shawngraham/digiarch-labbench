    "The [Pompeii Artistic Landscapes Project](https://palp.art/start) tries to describe all of the art that once hung on or was once part of the walls of Pompeii. It uses the idea of the 'triple' to describe the concepts, their interrelationships, and their locations:\n",

    "> The Pompeii Artistic Landscape Project (PALP) is an online resource that supports site-wide discovery, mapping, analysis, and sharing of information about Pompeian artworks in their architectural and urban contexts. The goal of PALP is to dramatically increase the number of researchers and members of the public who can access, analyze, interpret, and share the artworks of the most richly documented urban environment of the Roman world: Pompeii.\n",
