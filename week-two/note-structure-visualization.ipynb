    "This is a computational notebook file, signalled by the use of `.pynb` in the filename. This notebook contains python code that will visualize the data in the `wikilink-index.json` file created by our lab-bench's 'backlinks' function. That is to say, as you develop linked thoughts, the backlinks function keeps track of the structure of your notes, and this present file can visualize it as a network aka 'graph'. \n",

    "Make sure your file tray at left has a file called 'wikilink-index.json'. This gets generated when you first examine your lab bench for back links by hitting alt/option b to open, close, then re-open the backlinks panel. Examine that file. You'll see that there is a 'key' called 'links' and another key called 'backlinks'. These two structures get updated with the information showing how all your notes interlink.\n",

You'll know that the cell has run when the little [ ] at the left of each cell changes from [ ] to [*] to [1]. The numbers keep track of the order in which you've run the cell. Some cells merely 'set the stage' as it were, importing the little pieces of pre-made code we'll use; others define functions that we'll run later. You need to run those 'stage setting' cells, or else when you actually DO run a function (eg `load_wikilink_data`) you'll get errors."
