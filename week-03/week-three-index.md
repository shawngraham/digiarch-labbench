## Week Three

This week, you're going to explore a few notebooks that enable you to do different kinds of spatial analysis. Approach them in this order:

- [[quick-map-with-geojson.ipynb]]
- [[linlithgow_spatial.ipynb]]
- [[r_kernel_install.ipynb]]
- [[r-for-gis.ipynb]]
- [[LiDAR.ipynb]]

**Remember** it's not about how many you _complete_, it's about how far you push yourself out of your comfort zone.

When you're done with a computational notebook, remember to ctrl+s to save things, and then right-click on the name of the file in the file tray at left, and select 'Shut Down Kernel'. This will free up computational resources.

## Python versus R

In the [[linlithgow_spatial.ipynb]] file, you used Python. In [[r-for-gis.ipynb]] you're using R. You might wonder, what's the difference? Why the difference? Many archaeologists only use one or the other, but sometimes, they also switch around and use one language for one kind of task and one language for another. It really just comes down to a person's training and preferences. Sometimes, a researcher or programmer might have made a 'package' in one language or another for doing some specific task, and that package might not have an equivalent in the other, and so we end up switching as needs be. 

Python is more general-purpose and in a way easier to read than R (you _can_ read it left-to-right and get a sense of what's going on, even if the specifics are a bit opaque). R was develop more with explicit statistical usages in mind, and can also make nicer output for eventual publication.
