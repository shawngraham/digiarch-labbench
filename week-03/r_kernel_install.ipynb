    "### Problem: R kernel doesn't appear in Jupyter\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. Completely restart JupyterLab (close and reopen)\n",
    "2. Make sure R is installed and working from command line\n",
    "3. Try the manual installation method in Step 6\n",

    "### Problem: \"R not found\" error\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. Make sure R installation completed successfully\n",
    "2. Add R to your system PATH\n",
    "3. On Windows: R is usually in `C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-x.x.x\\bin`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: Package installation fails\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. Check your internet connection\n",
    "2. Try installing packages manually in R console\n",
    "3. Use a different CRAN mirror: `install.packages(\"IRkernel\", repos=\"https://cloud.r-project.org\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Still having trouble?\n",
    "1. Ask your instructor for help\n",
    "2. Check the JupyterLab documentation\n",
    "3. Visit the IRkernel GitHub page: https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel\n",
